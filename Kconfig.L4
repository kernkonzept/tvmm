config TVMM_GIC_DIST_BASE
	hex "GICD base address"
	default 0xf0000000
	help
	  Address of the GICv3 distributor.

config TVMM_GIC_REDIST_BASE
	hex "GICR base address"
	default 0xf0010000
	help
	  Address of the GICv3 redistributor.

config TVMM_GIC_VIRTUAL_SPIS
	int "Number of virtual SPIs on GIC"
	default 992
	help
	  This setting purely reflects what is reported to the guest in the
          GICR_TYPER register. The memory consumption of tvmm solely depends on
          the number actually assigned IRQs to the VMs.

	  Allowed range: [0 .. 992]. Will be rounded up to the next multiple
	  of 32.

config TVMM_MAX_VMS
	int "Number of supported VMs per tvmm instance"
	default 4

config TVMM_HEAP_SIZE
	int "Heap size"
	default 16384

choice
	prompt "Guest fault mode"
	default TVMM_FAULT_HALT
	help
	  Choose how the vmm should handle invalid memory accesses of the
	  guest.

config TVMM_FAULT_HALT
	bool "Halt"
	help
	  The guest is halted.

config TVMM_FAULT_INJECT
	bool "Inject"
	help
	  The invalid access is reflected as data- or prefetch-abort to the
	  guest.

config TVMM_FAULT_IGNORE
	bool "Ignore"
	help
	  The vmm ignores the access. Reads will return 0 and writes will be
	  silently discarded.

	  Attention: only ldr instructions are decoded. Other loads (ldp, ldm)
	  will *not* return 0 but leave the destination register unchanged.

config TVMM_VM_CTRL_IFC
	bool "VM control interface"
	help
	  Support controlling and monitoring guest state through an IPC
	  interface.

config TVMM_ELF_LOADER
	bool "ELF loader"
	help
	  Support loading guests from an ELF file.

	  Ususally the guest is loaded outside of tvmm. But if a guest needs to
	  be restarted it must usually be loaded again.
